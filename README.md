# Expo and TypeScript Starter

This is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) demo app using the [Expo framework](https://expo.io) and written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org). It uses the [managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).

This repo used to also contain a type definition file for Expo. That work was merged into the [`@types/expo`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/expo) package. `@types/expo` is now deprecated in favor of definition types includes with the `expo` package. TypeScript FTW!

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- Optional: [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), since it includes the iOS Simulator. XCode only runs on Macs.
- Optional: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), since it includes the Android Virtual Device Manager.

You don't need to install any global npm packages for this repo. `expo-cli` is included as a dev dependency.
